      <h2>Circular Flow and GDP</h2>
      <div>
        <div><b>Product Market:</b> where economic goods are services are exchanged</div>
        <div><b>Resource Market</b> where factors of production (resources [look at unit 1]) are exchanged</div>
        <img src="src/images/CircularFlow.jpg" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>GDP: the total value of goods and services made in a year that were purchased <b>in that same year</b>
        </div>
        <h6>Components of GDP</h6>
        <ol>
          <li>Consumer Spending: value of goods/services bought by consumers</li>
          <li>Investment Spending: spending done by business (to invest in themselves)</li>
          <li>Government Spending: spending done by the govt.</li>
          <li>Net Exports: Total imports subtracted from total exports</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Limitations of GDP</h2>
      <div>GDP alone can't be used to measure the strength of the economy of a nation</div>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Population:</b> Countries with the same GDP but different population sizes can't be compared</li>

        <li><b>Inequality:</b> GDP doesn't tell how the money with different nations are distributed to the people (ex.
          equality, 50% cash owned by 1%)</li>
        <li><b>Environment:</b> Environmental situations also dictate health of the economy</li>
        <li></b>Shadow Economy:</b> Some transactions are not reported in the GDP measure</li>
      </ol>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Unemployment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Labor Force:</b> anyone 16 years or older willing and able to work (in the past 30 days)</li>
        <li><b>Unemployment Rate: </b> the percentage of those in the labor force who don't have a job</li>
        <li><b>Labor Force Participation Rate: </b>workers employed divided by the labor force</li>
        <li><b>Natural Rate of Unemployment: rate of unemployment at full-employment level</b></li>
        <li><b>Frictional Unemployment: </b>unemployment caused by workers who are temporarily unemployed or currently
          in between jobs (ex. seasonal, waiting for offer)</li>
        <li><b>Structural Unemployment: </b>unemployment caused by workers whose skills have become obsolete (ex.
          technology)</li>
        <li><b>Cyclical Unemployment: </b>workers who are unemployed due to economic contraction; current U.E.R. -
          natural U.E.R.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Price Indices and Inflation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Consumer Price Index: </b>a measure that evaluates how much prices have changes from base year</li>
        <li><b>Inflation Rate: </b>the percent change in the price level of the economy from year to year</li>
        <li><b>Deflation vs Disinflation: </b>the former is negative inflation, the latter is a lower inflation rate
          than the year prior</li>
        <li><b>Real variables: </b>variables where the effects of inflation have been factored out</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <b>Consumer Price Index is calculated by doing the following:</b>
      </div>
      <div>(Current Market Basket)/(Base Year Market Basket) x 100:</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Costs of Inflation</h2>
      <div>Unanticipated inflation can lead to unexpected effects, such as the following: </div>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Menu Costs: </b> firms changing prices on "menus" p(ex. Walmart hiring more employees to changing price
          tags frequently)</li>
        <li><b>Shoe Leather Costs: </b>the cost of additional time/effort people spend due to inflation (ex. businesses
          running to banks to get cash money more frequently) </li>
        <li><b>Loss of Purchasing Power: </b>the unit of cash in a nation being worth less</li>
        <li><b>Wealth Redistribution: </b>Real value of wealth being transferred from borrowers to lenders (due to
          unexpected changes in real interest rates for loans)</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        <b>Inflation Rate is calculated by doing the following:</b>
      </div>
      <div>(Current Market Basket - Base Year Market Basket)/(Base Year Market Basket) x 100:</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Real vs Nominal GDP</h2>
      <div><b>Nominal GDP: </b>GDP that doesn't account for inflation (just the total dollar value)</div>
      <div>
        <b>Real GDP: </b> nominal GDP divided by <b>the GDP Deflator</b>; more accurate since inflation is account for
      </div>
      <div>
        <h6>GDP Deflator is calculated by the following:</h6>
        <div>(Nominal GDP) / (Real GDP) x 100</div>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Business Cycles</h2>
      <div style="background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.361); padding: .25rem;">RGDP above the growth trend line correlates with
        lower
        unemployment rate and
        higher aggregate price
        levels (the opposite is true)</div>
      <div><b>Peak: </b>the highest point of RGDP before a contraction starts</div>
      <div><b>Trough: </b>the lowest point of RGDP before a expansion starts</div>
      <div><b>Recession: </b>two straight fiscal quarters of RGDP contraction</div>
      <div><b>Expansion: </b>any period of RGDP growth</div>
      <div><b>Contraction: </b>any period of RGDP reduction</div>
      <div><b>The Growth Trend Line: </b>represents natural rate of RGDP growth, full employment. and the natural rate
        of unemployment</div>
